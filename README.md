I'd like to build an app called "Mind", designed to help users reflect on their emotional well-being throughout the day. The app would include features like quick mood check-ins and journaling prompts to encourage daily self-reflection. I also envision it as a semi-anonymous social network, where users can connect with trusted “friends” who help keep them accountable and supported. In addition, the app would provide educational content to help users learn more about mental health and foster a positive, supportive community.

## Notes

I had never used Xcode before, and there was a lot going on, I wasn’t sure where to find anything at first. It also ran pretty slowly for some reason. The project itself was simple, but the interface felt overwhelming with tools and panels everywhere. Still, it was really cool to create my first ever app!
